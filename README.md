## Task 1: The 'processArray' Function
- This function takes an array of numbers as an argument.

## Task 2: The 'formatArrayStrings' Function
- This function takes two arrays: one of strings and one of numbers processed by `processArray`.
- It modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the string if the number is even, or converts it to lowercase if the number is odd.

## Task 3: The 'createUserProfiles' Function
- This function takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2.
- It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
